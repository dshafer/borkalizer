# The Borkalizer
Politics - it's everywhere, especially on facebook.  Your friends and family, otherwise
reasonable and intelligent people, are for some reason compelled to turn their wall
(and yours) into an obnoxious cesspit of election-year drivel.  The Borkalizer is here
to help you take your wall back.  You can view the results at [borkalizer.com](http://borkalizer.com).

### What It Does
Using Bayesian classification (the same method used to filter spam out of your email), The Borkalizer
scans posts on facebook and tries to identify politically-oriented posts.  When it finds one,
it transforms the text using a swedish-chef filter to make it as hilarious as possible.
